12. 
    a. There have  been 5 commits (personal commits)
    
    b. The .gitignore was modified by optimus9p on August 24th, 2015
    
    c. The graph section indicates that there were four commits on the week of August the 23rd but
    it doesn't say anything about August 21st. Not sure if this is a typo or I'm just not seeing anything on the 21st.
    
    d. The src file was modified 5 times
    
    e. git status lists the files that have been changed but have yet to be committed
       git log prints out the commits that have been filed in order
       
    f. git show [commit] will show you the main.java commit
    
    g. You want to first bring up the history with git log and then you want to append --grep=<whatever word you're looking for>
    
    h. Same thing with g but we're gonna use git log --author="Lauren" --before 02/16/2016 --after 01/05/2016
